## [0.4.0] - unreleased

### Added

- **Persistent Agents** — a third Task tier alongside Repo Tasks and Standalone Tasks. Long-lived, named, message-driven agents that wake on user messages, agent messages, webhooks, cron ticks, or ticket events. Each agent has a stable slug, addressable by other agents in the same workspace via an inter-agent HTTP API. Three configurable pod lifecycle modes: `always-on`, `sticky` (default, with idle warm window), and `on-demand`. Cyclic state machine reconciled by the existing K8s-style control plane (now a fourth `RunKind`: `persistent-agent`). New `/agents` UI with chat, turn history, live activity stream, and pause/resume/restart/archive controls. See [docs/persistent-agents.md](docs/persistent-agents.md) and the four-agent demo in [demos/the-forge](demos/the-forge/README.md).
- **Issues** as a top-level nav item — the GitHub Issues queue is now its own page at `/issues`, promoted out of the `/tasks` tab strip.
- **Reviews** as a top-level nav item — code-review subtasks plus external PR reviews now live at `/reviews` (and `/reviews/:id`), with their own reconciler `RunKind` (`pr-review`).
- **Examples directory** — runnable, self-contained agent configurations under [`examples/`](examples/README.md), starting with two Persistent Agent setups (Forge and Mars Mission Control). Each example is idempotent — re-running `setup.sh` is safe.

### Changed

- **Sidebar nav reorganized.** The hub-and-tabs `/tasks` page is gone. Each tier has its own dedicated route, grouped into **Run** (Tasks · Jobs · Reviews · Issues · Scheduled) and **Live** (Agents · Sessions). The Library group renamed "Templates" to **Prompts** to free that label. Legacy `/tasks?tab=…` URLs redirect to the dedicated pages.
- **User-facing names finalised.** Repo Tasks → **Tasks**; Standalone Tasks → **Jobs** (matching the existing `/api/jobs` URL); PR Reviews → **Reviews**; Persistent Agents → **Agents**; Templates (in the Library) → **Prompts**. Backend table names (`tasks`, `task_configs`, `workflows`, `prompt_templates`) are unchanged.

### Migration notes

> Upgrading from 0.3.x — there are no required user actions. URL/nav changes:
>
> - `/tasks?tab=standalone` → `/jobs` (auto-redirected)
> - `/tasks?tab=issues` → `/issues` (auto-redirected)
> - `/tasks?tab=prs` → `/reviews` (auto-redirected)
> - The "Templates" sidebar item is now labeled **Prompts** but still points to `/templates`.
> - The new `/agents` route requires the v0.4 schema migration (`1777200001_persistent_agents.sql`) — applied automatically on API startup.
>
> No data migration is needed. Existing tasks, workflows, triggers, and templates continue to work unchanged.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **External PR auto-review** — review agent for PRs on external repos with chat + one-click merge, lifted into its own primitive alongside task-generated reviews.
- **Google Vertex AI authentication mode for Claude Code** — route Claude through GCP Vertex AI using `CLAUDE_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` / `CLAUDE_VERTEX_REGION` and an optional (encrypted, global-scope) service account key, with workload-identity fallback (#478).
- **Workload identity support** for agent pods, plus fixes to repo pod lifecycle (#486).
- **User-scoped secrets** — keep identity tokens out of the pod env and scope them per user (#474).
- **Secrets injected into pod env for setup commands** (#471), and an OAuth refresh widget on `/secrets` that hides the banner when visible.
- **Resume stopped agents on chat message** — sending a chat message to a stopped task resumes the agent (#488).
- **Multi-repo + multi-tracker ticket integration** — redesigned setup flow (#489).
- **Dynamic per-provider model & options picker** with a refresh button for agent settings (#493).
- **Gemini model options** updated with new preview models (#490).
- **GKE & Gateway deployment enhancements** in the Helm chart (#461).
- **Diagnostic logging for raw error detection** in agent adapters (#467).

### Changed

- **PR reviews folded into the Tasks page** — removed the sidebar duplicate; task and PR-review detail views now share primitives (#494, #485, f1a6da4).
- **Repo settings page** — split external PR review out and tabified agent settings (#487).
- **Standalone Tasks pipeline stats bar** restored on the overview page.
- **Opus model option bumped from 4.6 to 4.7** (#491).

### Fixed

- Reconciler: guard PR-reactive actions (auto-merge, complete-on-merge, review launch) to coding tasks only so external PR reviews don't trip them (#480).
- Reviews: stop writing external PR URLs to `pr_review` task rows (#481).
- Secrets: downgrade `scope='user'` to `'global'` when auth is disabled.
- API: derive Claude/Codex/Gemini mode from secret names on public `/setup/status` (#477).
- Auth: add OIDC routes to public auth routes so login works before a session exists (#479).
- Helm: restore `chown` capabilities in postgres init containers (#482); fix postgres volume permissions and decouple `isSetUp` from runtime health (#472).
- Images: change agent user UID from 1000 to 1001 to avoid conflicts on managed node images (#466).
- Gemini agent: settings validation, parser crash, and exit-code inference (#463).
- Correct sub-hour timezone drift in `getETDate` (#462).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- Ticket sync: fall back to the configured GitHub App (or `GITHUB_TOKEN` PAT) when a GitHub ticket provider has no inline token or provider-specific secret. Previously sync hard-failed with `"GitHub provider requires token, owner, and repo in config"` even when a GitHub App was fully configured (#458).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Pooled standalone-task pods** — runs within a workflow now share pods, scaling out to `workflows.maxPodInstances` replicas each hosting up to `workflows.maxAgentsPerPod` concurrent runs (mirrors repo pod scaling). Runs track assigned pods via `workflow_runs.pod_id` with `last_pod_id` for retry affinity, and pool selection follows preferred → least-loaded → scale-up → overflow. Fixes a leak where a burst of triggers would spawn one pod per run even though only a few ran at once.

### Changed

- **Reconciliation control plane is now authoritative** — the K8s-style reconciler (shadow mode in 0.2.0) now owns PR-driven transitions, auto-merge, complete-on-merge, fail-on-close, auto-resume, review launch, stall detection, pod-death detection, and control intent (cancel/retry/resume/restart) for both Repo Tasks and Standalone Tasks.
- **Shared auth banner, state badge, and metadata card** across task pages for a consistent UX.

### Fixed

- Reconciler: clear stale `finishedAt` when retrying a standalone run.
- Reconciler: use unique jobIds for executor enqueues to prevent BullMQ dedup collisions.
- Agent adapters: include `cache_read` and `cache_creation` tokens in input totals (#457).
- API: trigger auth banner when the usage endpoint detects an expired OAuth token (#455).
- API: detect Claude auth failures mid-run in standalone task runs and override nominally-successful exit codes.

### Docs

- Document the unified reconciler and the Repo vs Standalone Task model.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Unified Task model** — single polymorphic `/api/tasks` HTTP resource covering Repo Tasks, Repo Task blueprints, and Standalone Tasks; unified resolver across `tasks`, `task_configs`, and `workflows`

- **Reconciliation control plane (shadow mode)** — K8s-style reconciler for task and pod state, running in observe-only mode
- **StatefulSets for repo pods, Jobs for workflow pods** — native K8s controllers replace ad-hoc pod management
